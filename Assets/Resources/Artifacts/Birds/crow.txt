Crow
Crows are black birds known for their intelligence and adaptability, and for their loud, harsh "caw." They are common sights in treetops, fields, and in habitats ranging from open woods and empty beaches. Their flight style is unique, a patient, methodical flapping that is rarely broken up with glides.
