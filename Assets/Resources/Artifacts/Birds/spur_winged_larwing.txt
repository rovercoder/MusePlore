Spur Winged Larwing
Spur­winged plovers are now widespread in a wide range of open habitats throughout New Zealand. They may be found in almost any area with low vegetation, often near water. Spur-winged plovers are resident on the Chatham Islands, and vagrant birds have been recorded from the Kermadec, Bounty, Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands.
