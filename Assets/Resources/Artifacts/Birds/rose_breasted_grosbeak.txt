Rose Breasted Grosbeak
The striking rose­breasted grosbeak is a common bird of wooded habitats across much of eastern and midwestern North America. Singing from the canopy of a deciduous forest, even a brightly colored male can be difficult to locate. Look for these birds in forest edges and woodlands.
