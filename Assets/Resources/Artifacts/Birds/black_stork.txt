Black Stork
The black stork is a large and fairly secretive bird. The black head, upperparts, wings, tail and long neck have a conspicuous green, contrasting with the white belly, undertail and armpits. The long legs and long straight beak are bright scarlet in adults, especially during the breeding season, and a patch of scarlet skin also surrounds the eye.
