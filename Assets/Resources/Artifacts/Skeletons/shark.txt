Shark
The skeleton of the shark has changed and adapted to suit and aid the habitat, migration, hunting habits and diet of these acclaimed carnivores. Unlike terrestrial animals, sharks’ skeletons are made purely of cartilage and connective tissue, or muscle. There is no bone. This type of skeleton means that the shark is lighter, as cartilage is about half the density of bone. This is important because, unlike other fish, the shark has no swim bladder to prevent it from sinking to the bottom of the ocean.
