Dog
When looking at a dog, much of what people see is the result of the growth of the bones, muscles, joints, ligaments and tendons. The bones and muscles give the dog its general conformation or shape. There is an average of 319 bones in the dog skeleton. Other info: A puppy is born with all the bones, joints, muscles, ligaments and tendons that it will ever have. All growth is due to an increase in size of these tissues, not to an increase in their number.
