Tiger
The tiger is the largest member of the felid (cat) family. They sport long, thick reddish coats with white bellies and white and black tails. Their heads, bodies, tails and limbs have narrow black, brown or gray stripes. In the early 1900s, there were around 100,000 tigers throughout their range. Today, an estimated total of around 3,000­4,500 exist in the wild.
