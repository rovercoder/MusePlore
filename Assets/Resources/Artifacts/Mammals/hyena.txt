Hyena
The hyena is Africa's most common large carnivore. Over the years hyenas and humans have come into close contact in Africa as well as Asia and Europe. Spotted hyenas are famed scavengers and often dine on the leftovers of other predators. But these firm beasts are also skilled hunters that will take down wildebeest or antelope.
