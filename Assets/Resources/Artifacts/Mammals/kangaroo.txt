Kangaroo
Kangaroos are the largest living marsupials from the family Macropodidae. They are identified by their muscular tails, strong back legs, large feet, short fur and long, pointed ears. Like all marsupials, a sub­type of mammal, females have pouches that contain mammary glands, where their young live until they are old enough to emerge.
